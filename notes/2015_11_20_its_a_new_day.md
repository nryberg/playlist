2015-11-20 it is a new day

Data is finally being loaded - now to remove the dups.  On a station by station basis, you're pulling the last twelve plays over the last 30 minutes, and that's kinda difficult because even if a station played back to back, which they'd never do, it would max out at around 10 songs.  Possibly.

Carryover at the end of the line should shadow the next half hour.

Well the good news is that the website doesn't show the actual order of songs.  The bad news is that without order, I have no idea who's been played last.

Songs cast shadows - for at least the next wave.  In theory they could be played once every hour - maybe test out the really hard ones.

For the record, JSON is a real bear to read without a [pretty json tool](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/).
