At the point of entry

Right now I'm doing batch operations and chafing at the return times.  No wonder - it's  lot of data, and you should be doing testing on small quantities rather than the full Monty.  

Whether or not this would be solved by going to Postgresql is debatable - you still are going to have to pay the price in migration. You're still going to have now manage security at a higher level.  At the end of this rainbow however is the fact that Tableau will hook directly up to it - no fuss no muss.

On one level you're pulling back one of the chips of innovation - good!  On the other hand, and there always is another hand - you're going to incur the penalties of learning the new tech - not a bad thing since a) it's SQL at the core, and b) you need to keep learning.
