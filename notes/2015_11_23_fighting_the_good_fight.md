## 2015 11 23 - Fighting the good fight

Each block has a set of songs.  Some of those songs appear in the previous block.  If we take the blocks backwards, and roll up the songs to the most previous historical event... _hmmm_.

Walk the station list and pull the songs in time order.  For each station - pull
the sets of times.  Using the sets of time, 

stationid |        time         | count

For each block, you can then block out the next set.  It would be a walking
block though, 

A song has to be not listed for at least one segment before being listed again.
This means that there are stations that actually do play a song to death, but
since they're not playing that many songs to start with, they're just not going
to get a ton of credit.  It'll be interesting to see how that song drop factor
plays out.

For now, play it naive and let the songs fall where they may.
